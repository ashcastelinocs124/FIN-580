## Macro Regime

**Regime: Transitional (leaning Risk-On for cyclicals/energy)**

| # | Factor | Value | Direction | Signal |
|---|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ISM Manufacturing PMI | 52.6 | Rising | Bullish |
| 2 | ISM Services PMI | 53.8 | Flat | Bullish |
| 3 | Consumer Confidence | 84.5 | Falling | Bearish |
| 4 | PCE Inflation (Core) | 3.05% | Rising | Bearish |
| 5 | Fed Funds Rate | 3.50-3.75% | Hold | Neutral |
| 6 | Yield Curve (2Y-10Y) | +61bps | Steepening | Bullish |
| 7 | VIX | 21.77 | Rising | Bearish |
| 8 | DXY | 97.78 | Weakening | Bullish |
| 9 | Non-Farm Payrolls | +130K | Rising | Neutral |
| 10 | Sector Fund Flows | Massive rotation into Energy | Risk-On | Bullish |
| 11 | Geopolitical Events | US-Iran, Russia refinery attacks | Escalating | Bullish |
| 12 | Earnings Calendar | Q4 winding down | Light | Neutral |
| 13 | R2K vs S&P 500 | +8.7% vs +2% YTD | Outperforming | Bullish |
| 14 | Credit Spreads | Energy OAS 82bps | Tightening | Bullish |

### Tailwinds
- ISM Manufacturing expansion (52.6, up from 47.9 in December)
- Weakening dollar (DXY 97.78, down 8.27% YoY) — direct commodity tailwind
- Massive sector rotation: XLE +21.5% YTD, outperforming tech by 19 percentage points
- Russell 2000 outperforming S&P 500 by 6.7 points — small-cap momentum
- Energy credit spreads tightening (OAS 82bps, down from 108bps prior year)

### Headwinds
- Sticky PCE inflation at 3.05% — well above Fed's 2% target
- Consumer confidence at lowest since 2014 (84.5), Expectations sub-index below recession threshold
- VIX elevated at 21.77 (up from 13.38 low in December)
- IEA projects ~4 million bpd oil surplus for 2026
- Fed minutes floated rate hike possibility — hawkish pivot risk

## Sector Deep-Dive: Oil & Gas

### Sector Snapshot
- **Primary ETFs:** XLE (large cap) +14% 1M, +17% 3M | XOP (E&P) +1.35% YTD, +11.85% 1Y
- **WTI Crude:** ~$66.48/barrel, range-bound with $4-7 geopolitical risk premium embedded
- **Henry Hub Natural Gas:** Spiked to $7.72/MMBtu in January (+81% MoM), EIA 2026 avg forecast $4.30
- **vs S&P 500:** Massively outperforming by 16-18 percentage points (energy is #1 sector YTD)
- **Institutional Sentiment:** Increasing. Morgan Stanley +92.4% XLE stake in Q4. XOP +$131.5M 5-day inflows
- **Sub-Sector Focus:** E&P (upstream) for oil price leverage; natural gas E&P for winter demand tailwind

### Macro Sensitivity (Oil & Gas HIGH Factors)
| Factor | Sensitivity | Current Signal | Status |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------|
| DXY (Dollar) | **HIGH** | Weakening (97.78) | **Bullish** |
| Geopolitical Events | **HIGH** | Escalating (Iran, Russia) | **Bullish** |

**Macro Alignment Score: 2/2 HIGH factors bullish = 3/3 points**

### Catalysts (Next 2 Months)
1. **Earnings wave Feb 24 - Mar 5:** MTDR (Feb 24), GPOR (Feb 24-25), CRGY (Feb 25-26), CHRD (Feb 25), REPX (Mar 4) — all with 2026 guidance
2. **US-Iran diplomacy/escalation:** Ongoing after inconclusive Geneva talks Feb 17. Any military action or deal is the single biggest binary catalyst
3. **OPEC+ monthly review (~Mar 1):** Production pause currently through Q1. Surprise extension or unwinding moves the entire sector
4. **Natural gas surge:** Henry Hub averaged $7.72/MMBtu in January. Cold weather + LNG export demand benefits gas-weighted names

### Risks
1. **Supply glut:** IEA projects 3.7-3.8M bpd surplus. If geopolitical premium fades, oil could fall to $55-58/bbl. EIA forecasts Brent averaging $58/bbl
2. **Sector already up 17-20% YTD:** Much of the easy money may be made. Rotation back to tech possible
3. **Iran diplomacy breakthrough:** Nuclear deal could remove $4-7/bbl risk premium overnight
4. **Stronger USD:** Dollar strength would suppress oil prices (HIGH sensitivity factor)

## Stock Details

### 1. REPX — Riley Exploration Permian (9/12, High Conviction, 10%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $28.30 |
| Market Cap | $626M |
| Fwd P/E | 7.8x (vs sector ~14x) |
| RSI | 55 |
| vs 200MA | +7.3% |
| Analyst | Strong Buy, +62.5% upside (median target ~$46) |
| Dividend Yield | 5.7% |
| Sub-Sector | E&P (Permian NW Shelf) |

**Thesis:** Deepest value in the group at 7.8x forward P/E — nearly half the sector median. 12-15% oil production growth, $100M buyback authorized, 5.7% dividend yield provides dual return channels. Both HIGH macro factors bullish. Q4 earnings catalyst Mar 4.

**Key Risk:** CEO Bobby Riley selling 20K shares in December. $375M debt load exposed if oil breaks below $60 hedge floor on unhedged volumes.

**Trade Setup:** Entry $27.50-28.50 | Stop $24.00 (-15.6%) | Target $36-46 (+27-62%) | Risk/Reward ~1:3

---

### 2. CRGY — Crescent Energy (8/12, High Conviction, 8%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $10.71 |
| Market Cap | $2.7B |
| Fwd P/E | 8.4x (vs sector ~14x) |
| RSI | 63.7 |
| vs 200MA | +20.9% |
| Analyst | Strong Buy, +23.4% upside (avg target ~$14.78) |
| Sub-Sector | E&P (Eagle Ford) |

**Thesis:** Steep valuation discount with strong analyst consensus and an imminent Q4 earnings catalyst (Feb 25-26). Management expected to detail $90-100M in Vital Energy acquisition synergies, Uinta Basin upside, and FCF deployment. Volume exhaustion suggests selling pressure is fading.

**Key Risk:** Oil forecast to decline to ~$58/bbl; shale breakeven at $61-70 could compress margins. No insider buying despite 82% institutional ownership.

**Trade Setup:** Entry $10.50-10.75 | Stop $9.00 (-16.3%) | Target $13.50-14.00 (+26-31%)

---

### 3. MTDR — Matador Resources (8/12, High Conviction, 8%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $52.39 |
| Market Cap | $5.5B |
| Fwd P/E | 12.1x (vs sector ~14x) |
| RSI | 71.2 (overbought) |
| vs 200MA | +16.3% |
| Analyst | Strong Buy, broader targets $62-67 |
| Sub-Sector | E&P (Delaware Basin, Permian) |

**Thesis:** The quality pick — record production at ~210K BOE/day, capital discipline (CapEx down 8-12%), and the only stock with genuine insider buying (10,280 shares in 90 days). Hugh Brinson pipeline LNG-access coming online Q4 2026. 92% institutional ownership with Adage Capital +143% increase.

**Key Risk:** Technically overbought (RSI 71.2, +16.3% above 200MA). A guidance miss at Feb 24 earnings could trigger sharp retracement from extended levels.

**Trade Setup:** Entry $50.50-52.00 (prefer pullback) | Stop $45.50 (-12.5%) | Target $62.50-67.00 (+20-28%)

---

### 4. CHRD — Chord Energy (7/12, Moderate Conviction, 5%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $103-106 |
| Market Cap | $5.3B |
| Fwd P/E | 21.5x (above sector median) |
| RSI | 60.9 |
| vs 200MA | +9.1% |
| Analyst | Buy, +17.9% upside |
| Dividend Yield | 5.3% |
| Sub-Sector | E&P (Bakken/Williston) |

**Thesis:** Defensive dividend anchor with 5.3% yield and 69% of FCF returned to shareholders. Functions as the income stabilizer within the energy sleeve. Q4 earnings Feb 25 plus March investor conferences (JPM, MS, Piper) provide multiple catalysts.

**Key Risk:** Forward P/E at 21.5x is 54% above sector median — suggests market has already priced in much of the thesis. Insider selling is a caution flag.

**Trade Setup:** Entry $103-106 | Stop $93.50 (-9.2%) | Target $124-133 (+17-29%)

---

### 5. GPOR — Gulfport Energy (7/12, Moderate Conviction, 4%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $200-207 |
| Market Cap | $4.0B |
| Fwd P/E | 8.2x (vs sector ~14x) |
| RSI | 55.4 |
| vs 200MA | +8.1% |
| Analyst | Strong Buy (11 Buy / 3 Hold), +10-12% upside |
| Sub-Sector | E&P (Appalachia/Anadarko, natural gas weighted) |

**Thesis:** Natural gas pure-play benefiting from Henry Hub spike to $7.72 and EIA's upward-revised $4.30 avg for 2026. LNG export ramp (Plaquemines, Corpus Christi Stage 3, Golden Pass) structurally supports demand. Deep value at 8.2x P/E with $325M buyback program. MACD bullish divergence provides technical confirmation.

**Key Risk:** Insider selling across multiple executives. Natural gas price reversal from winter spike could compress earnings estimates. Analyst upside below 15% threshold.

**Trade Setup:** Entry $200-207 | Stop $183 (-8.5%) | Target $226-250 (+9-21%)

## Risk Notes

1. **Earnings concentration:** 4 of 5 stocks report within a 9-day window (Feb 24 - Mar 4). Correlated binary event risk. Consider staggered entries.
2. **Insider selling:** 3 of 5 stocks show insider selling (CHRD, GPOR, REPX). Only MTDR has genuine insider buying.
3. **Oil price structural headwind:** IEA 4M bpd surplus forecast. Goldman $56 Brent target, JPMorgan warned of $40. The geopolitical premium is the primary support.
4. **REPX liquidity:** $626M market cap — scale into position over 2-3 days to avoid slippage.
5. **Sector correlation:** All 5 positions are E&P. A sector shock hits the entire 35% allocation. Future runs for tech/copper will diversify.
